Description
Title of the project 
* A space with a taste of Mexican land. 
High-level project summary 
* Create a system that uses control methods for variables such as temperature, amount of O2, CO2, water, and light. Inspired by the Advanced Habitat Plant and the experiences written in the NASA media of astronauts to feed them in space and in a different environment like the planet Mars. Based on a mud structure that allows the absorption of water to keep the plants with permanent access to water. It solves the problem of microgravity since, thanks to the characteristics of the mud, the seeds adhere to it. The magenta light placed on top simulates sunlight that is not available in ships. And it serves as a guide to guide growth

Detailed project description 

Control system that contains a Hydroponic pot, which means that it does not need soil and the water inside it slowly spreads through its porous body, allowing water access to the plants. The mud has the nutrients that favor the growth of the plants that will be grown in the pots.

FLEXIBILITY FOR SMALL AND LARGE SPACES
A cluster of several pots can be formed, in each pot different types of crops and different types of plants can be generated that meet the requirements of a varied diet. Since astronauts' diet so far is based on packaged foods that deteriorate over time, fresh crops can be healthy for them, eat fresh food and also even help psychologically as astronauts often miss crisp textures like those in salads. and fruits and vegetables.

Variety of crops
The pot has an inner guide for plants that require additional support such as tomatoes, eggplant, tomato, and squash. The cylinder surface is designed for growing wheat germ. Wheat germ was chosen because it has quick and easy sprouting, it is grown all year round, it takes up very little space. It has vitamin B6, iron, selenium, and zinc. In addition to wheat germ, other types of plants can be grown, mainly vegetables or legumes.
We refer to past experiences in vegetables, where were grown Chinese cabbage, lettuce and kale



Control system Create a system that uses control methods for variables such as temperature, amount of O2, CO2, water, light and humidity. If we have more time, we can design the more precise control system. It is possible to replicate the system that will be sent into space, here on Earth, as the Kennedy Space Center did with the Veggie experiment. The conditions to which the experiment is subjected are equalized in space to later compare the results. 

Why is this design necessary?


•	Gravity would not be an impediment since, by not using soil, there isn’t risk of the detached particles damaging the instruments of the ship.
•	The ease of obtaining different types of crops.
•	Its small size and modular design allow a larger, resource-saving structure to be formed upon landing.
•	The greenhouse's manufacturing material ensures that it has the lowest possible weight inside the building.
•	If we have more time, we can investigate different types of materials and technologies that permit us make better fulfill this characteristic. Experiment and find other parameters that help the growth of plants in space. Develop a more efficient closed-loop control system and use all resources to their maximum utility
Advantage
•	It will help the astronauts' diet to be varied and nutritious.
•	A wide versatility of crops in space, test the crops that occur in the world and take them into space.
•	Measurement of the radiation of cultivated plants and subsequent experimentation with their seeds to improve the resistance of plants in outer space conditions. It will also help to understand the effects of microgravity, radiation and lack of sunlight on them.
•	The activity of growing plants such as vegetables and flowers has been shown to be beneficial for the mental health of astronauts, as shown by the experience of astronaut Scott Kelly who planted flowers on the international space station, which apparently haven’t useful function as food or special support to extreme conditions. But the aesthetic and natural value of planting flowers is a great achievement for humanity.
•	Feel another type of life in addition to that of the crew.
•	Growing plants in space, or on another celestial body such as the Moon or Mars is one more step towards the conquest of the Cosmos.

We investigate the experience of experiments such as Advanced Habitat Plant and Veggie
We investigated the ins and outs of the experiment and followed the story of astronaut Scott Kelly to understand the importance of growing seeds in space.
